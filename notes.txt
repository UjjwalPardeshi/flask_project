TaskGuardian
Description:
Role-Based Task Management System API
Build a backend system for a task management tool where users have different
roles. Admins can do everything, managers can assign tasks, and regular users can
complete tasks assigned to them. Make sure users can only access features based
on their role.
Roles:
Admin: Admin users have full access to all functionalities, including creating,
updating, deleting tasks, as well as managing users and their roles.
Manager: Manager users have access to creating, updating, and deleting tasks, as
well as assigning tasks to other users. They cannot manage users or roles.
Regular User: Regular users can view, create, update, and delete tasks assigned to
them. They cannot perform administrative tasks or assign tasks to others.
Technologies:
● Choose a backend framework like Express/Fastify (Node.js),
FastAPI/Flask(Python), Gin/Fibre (Golang) or Axum/Rocket (Rust)
● Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
Tasks:
1. Implement role-based authentication to restrict access to API endpoints
based on user roles.
2. Design and implement RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on tasks.

3. Create endpoints for assigning tasks to users and managing task statuses
4. Implement error handling for unauthorized access attempts and invalid
requests.
5. (Optional) Dockerize the application.
